            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FOr, although in Chriſt we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge two natures, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and the humane: Yet we do in no wiſe grant that the humane nature was therefore aſſumed, that either of this and that as of the parts there ſhould be conſtituted any new Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto Chriſt, or that the eternall Perſon which was before ſhould be made more perfect then before, by the acceſſe of a new nature; but this onely, That the humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſumed into the unitie of that Perſon, which was exiſtent from all eternitie, and alſo moſt perfect, the Son of God remaining what he was, might become what he was not, and might have what to offer to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for us.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170534:48"/>of Abraham into the unitie of the fame perſon: and further, for as much as the body and ſoul are two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as it appeareth in the creation of Adam; but the humane nature of Chriſt never ſubſiſted by it ſelf alone, but onely in the Perſon of the Son of God. From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, how unjuſtly ſome abuſe the godly ſaying of Athanaſius, to prove their own dreams and phanſies. For it is altogether neceſſarie that he which manifeſted himſelf (that is, the Perſon of the Son of God) ſhould be different from the fleſh in which he manifeſted himſelf; and that not onely before, but alſo after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and his ſeſſion at the right hand of the Father: which (as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

                  <p>ANd we believe and confeſſe, That the two natures of Chriſt are ſo truely and inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and united into one Perſon: that yet notwithſtanding we doubt not to ſay, that each ſtill remaineth entire and perfect, and truely diſtinct one from the other, and each ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it's own diſtinct eſſentiall properties and operations, without all manner of confuſion: ſo that, as the divine retaining it's own proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, remained uncreate, infinite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, ſimply omnipotent, ſimply wiſe: So alſo the humane retaining it's properties, remaineth created, finite, and terminated by certain bounds. And again, as the divine hath it's own proper will and power, by which Chriſt as God willeth and worketh the things which are of God: So likewiſe the humane hath

                     <hi>He which is true God, is alſo true man; neither is there any lye in this unitie, whilſt there is in Chriſt both the humilitie of the humanitie, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitie of the Deitie.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170534:50"/>as the natures in Chriſt are indeed united, but yet remain ſtill diſtinct, and not confuſed: So likewiſe the actions, both were and are: becauſe the fleſh, and not the <hi>Word,</hi> did the things belonging to the fleſh; and, the <hi>Word,</hi> and not the fleſh, did the things belonging to the <hi>Word.</hi> To raiſe up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> was a work proper onely to the <hi>Word;</hi> but to cry,<note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 11.43.</note>

So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to forgive ſinnes, was an action proper onely to the divine nature; but to ſay,<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 9.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy ſinnes be forgiven thee,</hi> this was proper onely to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.

                     <hi>Goe</hi> and <hi>waſh,</hi> this was proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the humane. Therefore the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall</hi> union, as it confounded not the natures, ſo neither did it confound

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170534:51"/>himſelf, neither hath he his divine eſſence from himſelf, but from the Father; and yet he is equall to the Father and hath the ſame nature with the Father. <hi>The other errour</hi> is committed, in attributing divine, and ſo infinite properties, as <hi>infinite power,</hi> unto the humane nature; and ſo taking from it the finite properties thereof: Even as the great light of the Sun taketh away the light of a candle; or as the glory which ſhall be communicated unto our bodyes at the reſurrection, ſhall take from them all their diſhonour and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. For where an infinite power is an Agent, and worketh; there a finite power is idle and none at all. But this Hereſie hath been ſo fully and perſpicuouſly refuted by many learned men in our age, that for our parts being here to ſet forth a brief and ſimple confeſſion of our faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God, and all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; we will not adde any thing more to that which hath been ſaid.</p>

                     <hi>God</hi> (that is, Chriſt Man and God) <hi>hath purchaſed the Church with his own bloud:</hi> whereas the force of the purchaſe pertaineth unto the Deitie, or Godhead; and the pouring out of bloud onely unto the humanitie or Manhood: Yet both theſe Actions are joyned together in one, and both are attributed unto the whole Perſon of Chriſt; although they were and are diſtinguiſhed: For although the natures be diſtinguiſhed, yet are they coupled together in the Perſon of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170534:52"/>Chriſt, which is but one. Yet further, Chriſt as Mediatour, never did or doth any thing according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, whereunto his divinitie did not and doth not cooperate, or work together: and again, he did nothing according to his divinitie, whereunto his humanitie did not conſent and willingly agree. And therefore well did the Fathers in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the operations or actions of Chriſt as Mediatour, operatious <hi>Theandricall,</hi> that is of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man. In the ſecond place,</hi> As the force of the union which is between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son is ſo great, that he doth nothing, neither communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth unto the world any good but by the Son: In like manner, ſo great is the force of the Hypoſtaticall union of the two natures in Chriſt, that there flowes unto us no grace, no ſalvation, no life, from the Deitie, but by the humanitie apprehended of us by faith: ſo that it is altogether neceſſarie that he be coupled unto the fleſh of Chriſt, whoſoever will be made partaker of eternall life: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of our Saviour,<note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 6.13.</note>

                     <hi>And when he bringeth in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, And let all the angels of God worſhip him; him,</hi> that is, the whole Perſon, God and Mau to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: whereas yet the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by it ſelf, and in it ſelf merely conſidered, neither can, nor ought to be worſhipped: For God onely is to be worſhipped. But it is not any union, but the Hypoſtaticall union of the divine and humane nature which effects this, that we have ſaid. Wherefore, although God dwelleth in his Saints; yet are not they to be worſhipped or pray'd unto, as is the Man Chriſt. Great therefore ſurely, we confeſſe, is the union whereof we
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170534:53"/>ſpeak: but yet ſuch is the union, that it excludes all confuſion, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.

                  <p>FOr the Goſpel propounding and ſetting before us Chriſt with the full grace and mercie of God, with full expiation and remiſſion of ſins, with perfect ſalvation and eternall life, requireth onely three things of us. The firſt is, that grieving hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely for the ſins committed in the whole courſe of our life paſt, we deſire of God even from our hearts and ſouls to change and renew our minds, wills, and affections, to the obedience of his divine will, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſtudying for it and begging it of him by our prayers. The ſecond is, that by faith laying hold on Chriſt with all the treaſure of his merits, we believe certainly &amp; without all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doubting, that all our ſins, of the grace and mercie of God for Chriſt's ſake onely, are pardoned
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170534:73"/>and forgiven for ever; that we are received into grace, and made the Sons of God, and heires of eternall life. The third and laſt is, that being perſwaded of the free pardon and forgiveneſſe of our ſins and eternall ſalvation, for Chriſt's ſake and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, we afterwards labour to keep and obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded us, for the glorie of God, and the ſalvation of our neighbour: keeping faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes even unto the end, and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believing that whatſoever ſins we commit in our new obedience are not imputed to us, and that for Chriſt's ſake onely: as alſo, that, by the imputation of Chriſt's moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, unto us; our imperfect obedience is made perfect, and ſo reputed, and accepted for moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in the ſight of God. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Chriſt may be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto three: <hi>That denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live</hi> SOBERLY (in reſpect of our ſelves) RIGHTEOUSLY (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our neighbour) and GOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY<note n="a" place="margin">Tit 2.12.</note>

                  <p>ANd it appears ſufficiently by what hath been ſaid, That we confound not the Law with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: For, although we confeſſe that God is the Authour of the Law, as well as the Goſpel; and again, that<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note> 
                     <hi>the Law</hi> of it ſelf is <hi>holy and juſt, and good,</hi> as well as the Goſpell: yet we believe that there is a great deal of difference between them; and that not onely, becauſe that was delivered to the Iews onely; whereas the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell belongeth unto all nations: nor
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170534:74"/>yet onely, becauſe that was tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratie, and to laſt onely untill Chriſt; whereas the Goſpel is everlaſting: not yet onely, becauſe, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Moſer, and expounded by the Prophets, whereas the Goſpel was brought unto us by Chriſt, and publiſhed unto the whole world by the Apoſtles: Not for theſe reaſons onely, I ſay, but more eſpecially for theſe which follow: <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the matters of the Law conſiſts in commandments, with curſes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable added thereunto, if they be broken in the leaſt part. It hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the promiſes not onely of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and temporall bleſſings; but alſo of heavenly and eternall: but yet they are all with a condition of moſt perfect righteouſneſſe and obedience, and not of free grace. But the Goſpel is properly the meſſage of glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, freely ſetting before us Chriſt our Redeemer, freely pardoning and forgiving ſins, and ſaving us: not requiring any thing at our hands for the attainment of ſalvation, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true faith in Chriſt, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have without repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170534:74"/>with a care to do Gods will, as we declared before. <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law did not enable us for the doing of that which it required; for it gave us no power whereby we might be ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>faith cometh by hearing</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: but obedience cometh not by hearing the Law: For the holy Ghoſt at the hearing of the Law did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to keep it, whoſoever heard the ſame: whereas it doth ſtirre up faith in the elect at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Goſpel. For which cauſe, as the Law is called the killing letter, ſo the Goſpel is called the quickning
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170534:75"/>Spirit, or the<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note> Spirit giving life: And therefore it is a true and effectuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and meanes unto ſalvation to every one that believeth. From whence followes a third difference, which is this, that the Law was not wrote in the hearts of men: but in tables of ſtone, ſo that there was not any change in men wrought thereby: But the Goſpel is wrote in the hearts of the elect by the holy Ghoſt, and worketh in them<note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> a change, and true renovation, being uſed by the holy Ghoſt as an inſtrument of our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>IT appears manifeſtly by what hath been ſaid, what our faith is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the abrogation of the Law, by the Goſpell.

                     <hi>the Law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth by Ieſus Chriſt. Secondly,</hi> Foraſmuch the Goſpel is one inſtrument of the holy Ghoſt, whereby we are ingrafted and united unto Chriſt, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of redemption and ſalvation (as we ſhewed in the 12. Chap:) In that regard we confeſſe that even the Morall Law alſo, as concerning the curſe denounced againſt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours thereof, is by the Goſpel of Chriſt abrogated: according to that of the Apoſtle,<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> A ſigne whereof, this is, that they<note n="d" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>walk not after the fleſh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit.</hi> But foraſmuch as the Doctrine of the Goſpel requireth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of us, and ſanctitie of our whole life, and that we live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteouſly, and godly: In this regard, I ſay, it taketh not away the

               <p>BEcauſe God, for the perfecting of our communion with Chriſt, wherein the participation of ſalvation wholly conſiſteth, hath been pleaſed to uſe not onely the word of the Goſpel alone by it ſelf, but alſo enternall ſignes fit for that purpoſe, and joyned together with the word, which two are required to the conſtituting of a Sacrament: Therefore in the next place, after our confeſſion concerning the Goſpel, we think good to adde a brief, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170534:77"/>Sacraments, and that agreeable unto the holy Scripture, and the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Chriſtian faith.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE I.</hi> What we underſtand by the name of Sacrament.</head>
                  <p>WE know that a Sacrament is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an holy oath, or promiſe on both parts, that is, made between God and his people: not ſimply; but alſo eſtabliſhed by certain holy rites and ceremonies: As it appeared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly in the Sacrament of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, between God and Abraham; and in Baptiſme, which ſucceeded in the place of circumciſion, between Chriſt and us. So a Sacrament is by the Fathers taken often for the whole Sacramentall action, whether of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, or of the Lords Supper: in which there goes before a promiſe on both parts, confirmed after an holy manner by externall rites, ſignes, and ſeals, and alſo by the bloud of Chriſt. But in after time by the name of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they underſtood by a figure called <hi>Synecdoche</hi> the rites onely, or
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170534:77"/>the viſible ſignes added unto the word. And this is another ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which prevailed and had place in the Church. Now we, according to the ſignification and uſe of the word in the Church, call a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not the word onely, nor the outward element onely, but the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the viſible ſignes, joyned with the word of the Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's inſtitution. Whereunto agreeth that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,<note n="a" place="margin">Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</note> 
                     <hi>The word is added unto the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo it becomes a Sacrament.</hi>

                     <hi>DOCT. II.</hi> Whereof the Sacraments are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</head>
                  <p>NOw, becauſe every Sacrament is the Sacrament of ſome thing: we ſay that this thing is that, which the word of the Goſpel doth ſignifie; to wit, the grace of God in Chriſt, or rather Chriſt himſelf together with grace and ſalvation placed in him. For Chriſt is the ſumme of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and, that we may have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: as was the word, ſo likewiſe were the Sacraments inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170534:78"/>and ordained, to put us in mind of him, and to raiſe up our thoughts unto him. And ſo, what is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibited unto us, we ſay, it is a ſigne of that which is inwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſet before us to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and, that which is done without, is a ſigne of that which the holy Ghoſt inwardly worketh in our hearts.</p>

                     <hi>DOCT. III.</hi> What the parts are whereof a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conſiſteth.</head>
                  <p>FRom hence alſo we come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the parts are, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Sacrament is properly ſaid to conſiſt, to wit, the word and the ſigne, or outward viſible element: but yet with a relation unto the thing by them ſignified, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and whereof they are a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For the thing, whereof any thing is a Sacrament, is not it ſelf neither can it be a Sacrament, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of a Sacrament: Foraſmuch as every Sacrament is a Sacrament of another thing which is different, and diverſe from it. But yet we do not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170534:78"/>ſimply and abſolutely ſeparate the thing it ſelf from the Sacrament: neither do we deny, but that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and many other learned and godly men do in the name of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comprehend the thing it ſelf, whereof any thing is a Sacrament: As by the name of Baptiſme is not onely the outward ablution or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water underſtood; but alſo therein is contained the inward purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the conſcience from ſin, and likewiſe regeneration: Therefore we embrace that ſaying of <hi>Ireneus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, that it doth conſiſt both of an earthly and heavenly matter: neither do we, when we ſpeak of the Sacraments, abſtain from ſuch manner of ſpeaking: yet in this ſenſe, not that the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is properly a part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is rather that, unto the participation whereof the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do lead us: But, becauſe the Sacrament hath a myſticall relation unto it; ſo that by the tye of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the earthly matter is knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the heavenly. And thus
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170534:79"/>we reconcile the ſayings of divers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and many other learned men, which may ſeem to jarre one with another: whereas they were all of one and the ſame mind every where: ſome calling the Sacraments ſimply by theſe and the like names, <hi>Signes, Figures, Reſemblances,</hi> or <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Types, Antitypes, Signets, Seals, Ceremonies,</hi> and the <hi>Viſible Word;</hi> others ſaying: that they conſiſt of an earthly and heavenly matter: which how it is to be underſtood we have declared already, all of them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after the manner of holy writ, calling them by the names of thoſe things, whereof they are Sacraments: whereas yet notwithſtanding they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood &amp; profeſſed that there were three things to be conſidered in the Sacraments, that is to ſay, the Word, the ſignes added unto the Word, and the things whereof they are ſignes.</p>

                  <p>WE believe alſo, and confeſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, that the viſible ſignes by Gods inſtitution were added unto the word, and that they were to be added, for the better and ſurer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the word in our mindes: it being the manner and cuſtome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every nation, to affix and ſet to their ſeals to their laſt wills and Teſtaments, as alſo to divers other writings. Which alſo is the reaſon, why the outward ſignes, which fall under our ſenſe, are called by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> the Viſible Word: to wit, becauſe they were inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and likewiſe added unto the word to this end, that they ſhould do the ſame thing which the Word doeth, that is to ſay, that, what the Word ſignifieth unto our eares, the ſame alſo ſhould they repreſent unto
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170534:80"/>confirme unto us the Word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God: And that, as by the Word faith is ſtirred up in our minds, ſo alſo by them as outward ſignes, and ſeals, it might be confirmed, ſealed, and every day more and more increaſed: And laſt of all, that as the Word, ſo alſo the holy ſignes might become as inſtruments for the holy Ghoſt to uſe for the bringing us to have communion with Chriſt, or for the making us to grow together in it. And we make no doubt or queſtion at all, but all this was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and appointed by God for our weakneſſe and ignorance, and for the imbecillitie of our faith: that it might be ſupported not onely by the Word, but alſo by the outward ſignes: Foraſmuch as faith it is, by which properly it comes to paſſe that we embrace and lay hold on Chriſt, and grow up together in him.</p>

                     <hi>DOCT. V.</hi> That where the Words of inſtitution are not recited; there is no Sacrament: And, that without the uſe thereof, the outward ſignes are no more then what they are of their own nature.</head>
                  <p>ANd, as we believe, that the ſignes are added unto the Word, not for ſuperſtition, but for the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith: ſo alſo we confeſſe, that the Word is neceſſarie in the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not for incantation, but for to ſtirre up faith in our hearts. And thereupon, when the Words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution are not ſo recited or rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as that they may be heard and underſtood, for the ſtirring up of faith: There, we deny any true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be; and conclude, that without the due &amp; lawfull uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the outward ſignes are no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but merely that, which they are of their own nature, and no more. For by the Word onely are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements or ſignes ſet a part for an holy uſe, which <hi>ſetting apart</hi> is by many called the <hi>Conſecrating,</hi> or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying</hi>

                  <p>NEither yet do we therefore take away or diminiſh the power and efficacie of the Sacraments given thereunto by God: Foraſmuch as we confeſſe that it depends upon faith, and the power of Chriſt who inſtituted, and ordained the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and, that it is neither ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away nor diminiſhed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe of the adminiſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or the receivers. For, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by it ſelf retaineth alwayes it's own power, efficacie, and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although all men do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; and again, as it hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170534:85"/>power to exhibite what it offereth to be received, although all men be not made partakers thereof: So alſo is it with the Sacraments, which are the viſible Word. For, as the Word by it ſelf alwaies is the power of God unto ſalvation, but not ſo to every one that heareth, unleſſe he alſo doth believe: So alſo the Sacraments are inſtruments which the holy Ghoſt uſeth alwayes efficacious unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although none partake of the efficacie thereof, but onely thoſe which do truely believe. For which cauſe the Apoſtle is not afraid to ſay that all thoſe which were Baptiſed, were<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note>

For by ſuch manner of ſpeaking is ſignified, the efficacie by God given unto the Sacraments, and what we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning the efficacie thereof, unleſſe perhaps our own hypocriſie be an hindrance and impediment thereunto. In which ſenſe if any one ſhall ſay that, whoſoever eate the bread of the Lord, they are made alſo partakers of the Lords body, that

                  <p>ANd, although we ſay, that the thing it ſelf of the Sacraments is not tyed and bound unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor included in them either Naturally, or Locally, or Corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by tye of obligation, as if God
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170534:86"/>ſimply and abſolutely had promiſed to give even the things themſelves to all the receivers of the Sacraments, though wanting faith; and further as if he were bound to give them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the impenitent and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: Yet we do not hereby take away all manner of conjunction and tye between the things ſignified and the ſignes: For we acknowledge and confeſſe a Sacramentall, that is, ſuch a union as may ſtand with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and the things of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now this Sacramentall union conſiſteth in a kind of myſticall and holy relation: inaſmuch as the ſignes do both ſignifie the things and alſo offer them to be received; and again the things are ſignified by the ſignes, and exhibited alſo to be received: As likewiſe there is a union between the word ſignifying and exhibiting, and the things by the word ſignifyed and exhibited. But this conjunction or union as well of the Sacraments, as of the word with the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, dependeth on the will and counſell of God, who did inſtitute them. For when he inſtituted the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170534:87"/>preaching of the Goſpel, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, he did it to this end and purpoſe which we have declared: and that we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, and beholding and receiving the ſignes ſhould preſently lift up the eyes of our minds unto the things thereby ſignified; and that by the hand of faith we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them being offered: and that we might truely and really be united unto Chriſt, who by the word is preached unto us, and by the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Sacraments is as it were pointed at with the finger. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our conjunction or joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt is altogether my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, as the<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 5.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teacheth: So alſo we hold that the union as well of the word as of the Sacraments with the things whereof they are ſignes and Sacraments, is myſticall and Spirituall.</p>

                  <p>FRom hence alſo we are confirmed in our opinion, that as the bread
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170534:97"/>is not properly the very body of Chriſt, but a Sacrament thereof, ſo likewiſe the body of Chriſt is not really and properly in the bread. For in Sacraments the things themſelves whereof they are Sacraments, are not really included, although they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receive the names thereof: As it appeareth plainly in Baptiſme without all controverſie: in which no man ſaith that either the bloud of Chriſt, by which we are waſhed from our ſins, or regeneration it ſelf is included: For neither in the word of the Goſpel are included really thoſe things, which thereby are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.

But, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this may be done by the true Godly as well as by thoſe which are hypocrites and ungodly, but yet after a different manner: the one ſort eating alſo by faith, and the other without true faith: Therefore alſo we ſay, that the ungodly and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites eat onely Sacramentally, but the true Godly both Sacramentally, and truely, and Spiritually, and ſo unto ſalvation.</p>

For it is the food of the mind, (as<note n="a" place="margin">Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. Serm. de Coena.</note>

                     <hi>by one Spirit we are all Baptiſed into one body, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> And if all our true union with Chriſt is by the holy Spirit, although he with his body be in heaven, and we on earth: It is neceſſarie alſo that the eating be after the ſame manner.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170534:100"/>of that part, for which it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Now the fleſh of Chriſt (as we ſaid before) is the food of the mind, and not of the belly.

To what end alſo is this, that as the bread is diſtributed without the wine, and the wine without the bread; ſo alſo the body without the bloud and the bloud apart without the body is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

                  <p>Furthermore, foraſmuch as this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating the fleſh of Chriſt, to wit, by faith, is certain and ſaving; and that other feigned manner of eating, by the mouth of the body, cannot be demonſtrated unto us out of the holy Scripture: and again, Though we ſhould grant that there may be ſome probabilitie for it, yet it is neither neceſſarie nor behoofull for the ſoul; but contrarily doth bring with it many miſchiefs into the Church, as monſtrous hereſies, idolatrie, worſhipping of idolls, ſtirrs, contentions, ſchiſmes, diſſipation of Churches, &amp; ſo expoſes our Chriſtian Religion to be derided by infidells. We believe that true pietie requires, that we reſt contented with that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating, which is by the Spirit and faith, not troubling our ſelves about the other, but taking our leave of that, embrace after a godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170534:102"/>and entertain brotherly charitie &amp; peace one with another; for which end alſo the holy Supper was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For laſt of all that manner of ſpeech cannot be granted in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, but as we are wont to ſay that we have received with our ears, what we underſtand by hearing the word with our ears. But we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together againſt bringing in into Chriſtian Religion ſuch phraſes, or manner of ſpeaking as is ſtrange and not uſed in holy Scripture, eſpecially if it be not onely unprofitable, but alſo pernicious.</p>

                  <p>WE believe then, that the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church is a companie of men<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note> choſen unto eternall life in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world, out of every nation and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: who in time by the<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 28.19 Mark 16.15.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170534:140"/>word of the Goſpel, adminiſter and receive the holy Sacraments accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt's inſtitution, and uſe all care and diligence that all men may live ſoberly, juſtly, and godly in this preſent world; as long as they are in the fleſh ever<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 6, 12, &amp;c.</note> fighting for the kingdome of Chriſt, againſt ſin dwelling in the fleſh, againſt the world whether alluring them unto ſin, or perſecuting them for Chriſt's ſake, and againſt the devil; waiting through patience for the coming of Chriſt, and for eternall happineſſe: Amongſt whom there are alſo many reprobates, and ungodly<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 13.5, &amp;c. and 21. 1 Ioh 2.19.</note> hypocrites profeſſing the ſame Chriſt: But as they are themſelves nothing leſſe then of the Church, ſo neither doth their hypocriſie and ungodlineſſe take away the Church, or extinguiſh &amp; blot out the name of the Church. For we deny not but under the name of the Church hypocrites alſo, which are in it, are comprehended: becauſe the Lord himſelf ſaith that it is like unto a flour in which there is wheat and chaffe; unto<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 13.24.</note> a field wherein is wheat &amp; tares, into a net in which are

For the Lord again taught as much in that place where he ſaid that he would<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 16.18.</note> build his Church in ſuch a manner that the gates of hell ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it; and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170534:144"/>care given unto any other which is contrarie thereto.

In the number of theſe extraordinarily called, we cannot but place many and heroicall and couragious men, and true ſervants of God in our times; who, when all was deſtroy'd, were excited by the Spirit of Chriſt to oppoſe themſelves againſt the Catholike Apoſtacie, and to reſtore anew the ancient doctrine, worſhip, &amp; diſcipline in the Church; and that notwithſtanding the vain reſiſtance and rage of the ordinary Biſhops, Kings, and moſt powerfull Princes, and all the world.</p>

                  <p>FOr we know that our God is the God of order, not of confuſion; and that the Church is preſerved by order: but ruin'd without it: for which reaſon he appointed many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct orders of miniſters, not onely heretofore in Iſrael, but alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Church gathered of

Therefore, whereas at firſt all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word were called both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Biſhops, and Presbyters, and were of equall authority, till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one began to preſide over his collegues, although not as a Lord, but onely as a Ruler in a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity over the other collegues, and the care of the whole Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eſpecially comitted to him, and ſo by way of eminency he alone was called by the name of Biſhop and Paſtor, the reſt of the miniſtery being contented with the title of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters (or elders,) ſo that in every City there was one Biſhop and many Presbyters; this we diſapprove not in our judgement. Concerning which the relation and opinion of St. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, (aſwell in other places, as in his Epiſtle to <hi>Euagmis,</hi> and in his commentaries on the Epiſtle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,<note place="margin">Tit. c. 10.</note> is received by us, where he ſaith, all this hath proceeded rather from cuſtome then from the direct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment

                  <p>BUt we believe them to be called by Chriſt to the miniſtry, whom he hath enabled and made fit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it; and thoſe fit, to whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the deſire of propagating the Kingdome of God, and glorifying God by a holy life, he hath given the knowledge of ſound doctrine, and abilitie to propound it to the people for their ſalvation, as the Apoſtle teacheth, both otherwhere and<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 2.6.</note> in the Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus. For whom God chooſeth and calleth to any function, he endues them with gifts neceſſary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame; ſince he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us rather in deed, then by words.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170534:167"/>And therefore they who hold not the ſound doctrine of the Goſpel, nor teach the ſame to the people, but rather that which is contrary unto it; whether they runne of their own accord, or are ſent by men, entruſted with the ordinary authority of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet we acknowledge them not for miniſters called by Chriſt, and conſequently do not account them fitting to be heard: as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

And we are not to ſeek for the reaſon hereof: For ſeeing<note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> miniſters are ſent of God for the edification of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170534:167"/>Church, which is rather deſtroyed by the doctrines of men, but built up by the word of God; certainly they are not ſent by God, who bring not his word with them.</p>

                  <p>COnſidering the truth of what we have already deliver'd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning miniſters extraordinarily called by Chriſt, we believe likewiſe that the Churches which Chriſt by their meanes and miniſtry reſtores and happily reformes, in ſetting up the preaching of true doctrine with the lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and purging the worſhip of God from idolatries and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and recalling the true forms of diſcipline, as much as is poſſible to be done, and conſequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Apoſtles; that they are true Churches.

                  <p>BUt for that this reaſon is not the leaſt, why believers doe and ought to live together in the ſame Cities, Towns and Villages, as far as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they may, namely to the end they might not only cheriſh their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou faith by holy communication daily amongſt themſelves in private, and exerciſe mutuall charity in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian offices, but alſo that they might in certain places and times aſſemble together to praiſe and call upon God publickly, to hear his word, partake the Sacraments, and perform the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick works of charity toward the poor; which things cannot be done without ſpeech, and rites, and ceremonies: therefore we declare our opinion of them alſo in brief after this manner. Seeing it is out of all doubt
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170534:177"/>that all things ought to be done in the Church to edification, all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſuperſtition removed from it; we conceive that true piety and the edification of the Churches do require, Firſt, as concerning <hi>Places,</hi> that if old and profained Temples be allow'd of, they ſhould be purg'd from all Idols, and from the reliques and footſteps of all idolatrie and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.

                     <hi>what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no <hi>Language</hi> be uſed, but ſuch as is underſtood by the whole Church. For what edification can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the Church from an unknown tongue? The Apoſtle alſo expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commands<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.21.</note> 
                     <hi>them to keep ſilence in the Church who ſpeake in an unknowne tongue,</hi> unleſſe the interpretation be added thereto. Thirdly, that all <hi>looſneſſe in apparell,</hi> all vanity, and every ſuch ornament which is more beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profane Theaters of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles then the ſacred Temples of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and condure more to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting of the fleſh then edifying of the Spirit, be aboliſh'd: But that all things be performed in the Churches
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170534:177"/>with the higheſt reverence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, as in the ſight of God and Angels. And although we conceive not that the form of apparell which Miniſters ought to wear either in or out of the Miniſtry, is to be ſo much Contended about as thereby to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the peace of the Churches: yet where the ſimplicity of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like times is neareſt approached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and immitated, thoſe Churches are judg'd moſt worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Fourthly, that every <hi>Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the Church be aſſembled into one holy Congregation; ſince we ſee that even from the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to theſe preſent, that day hath bene conſecrated and ſanctified to a ſacred reſt. Next to the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day we cannot but approve the ſanctifying of thoſe daies wherein the remembrance of the Nativity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion into Heaven, and ſending of the holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, was celebrated by the old Church. Upon other daies, as every Church ſhall judge it expedient they may
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170534:178"/>congregate the people to an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie to hear the word, and receive the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>NOr ought the Church to have leſſe care of the Sick then of thoſe that are in heath, or of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed then the living, ſeeing they are all members of Chriſt, and their bodies temples of the Holy Ghoſt. Wherefore we look upon it as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the right governing of the Church; that there be godly and prudent men appointed for the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sick, to comfort them out of the word of God and confirm them in the Faith, and if it be ſo, that the Sick be called out of the world by the Lord, to encourage them in their departure: ſhewing them that the ſouls of the faithfull, as ſoon as they forſake the body, do inſtantly goe to Chriſt in heaven, being carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither by the Spirit of Chriſt, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170534:180"/>accompanied with his Angels; and that they are bleſſed which die in the Lord. Moreover they may joyn in Prayer, and ſo goe along with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring perſons even to the haven, &amp; commend them to Chriſt.

In the mean while their Sepulchres and Dormitories are to be decently and reverently preſerv'd; as is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. Furthermore the children or parents, kindred and relations are to be comforted; and we do both teach and indeavour to perform all Offices of humanity toward them after the utmoſt of our power.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170534:182"/>whereby the ſumme of Chriſt an Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis taught: being thus inſtructed, he is to profeſſe his faith before the whole Church, and to promiſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt and his Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.10.

Thirdly, in regard that in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe we oftentimes fall, ſome more grievouſly and with greater ſcandall to the Church others leſſe hainouſly, therefore there is another particular conſiſting in the Cenſure of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;<note place="margin">Matt. 18 15. &amp;c. 1 Tim. 5.20.</note> to wit, that every one do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to their Cenſure, even to the end of his life, and admit of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correction.

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170534:183"/>thereof are chiefly theſe: Firſt, that they abſtain from many things, which otherwiſe may in ſome manner be tolerated in the laity: Such are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers delights of the fleſh, ſplendid equipage, coſtly banquets, rich houſhold ſtuffe, wicked ſervants, and the like.

                  <p>THeſe are the principal parts of diſcipline, without which there is no appearance how any Church can be duly governed and upheld. But how is it poſſible this diſcipline can be in ſuch places, where the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters never convene together, to know what is wanting, or what irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities are committed in the Church, to denounce againſt evill-manners, to judge of doctrines, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new happen to ſpring up, &amp; laſtly to deliberate of all things which concerne the welfare of the Church?

That the Church of Chriſt hath two heads; one invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and reſiding in heaven, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt; and another viſible, and ruling upon earth, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> with whom whoſoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not in all things pertaining to Religion, nor obeys him in all things, he has no place nor name in the Church, and cannot be ſaved. 6. To affirm of any particular Church that it cannot erre in matter of faith. 7. To confine the Church ſo to certaine places and perſons, as to ſay, There onely is the Church. 8. Not acknowledge them for Churches of Chriſt, which although they had the fundamentals of faith, yet doe not wholy accord in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or ſome point of doctrine with us. 9. To make a ſeparation from the Churches for every kinde of errour, or by reaſon of the bad life of ſome perſons. 10. To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that where the true doctrine,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170534:185"/>right manner of worſhip, and pure adminiſtration of the Sacraments, is excluded, there is notwithſtanding a true and Apoſtolical and pure Church, becauſe a continued ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Biſhops from the times of the Apoſtles can be demonſtrated therein; and contrarily, to deny thoſe to be true Churches, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they retain the pure doctrine, the Sacraments intire, and the right diſcipline, yet cannot ſhew a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and uninterrupted ſucceſſion and continuation of Biſhops. 11. That the authority of any Biſhop, as ſuch, does extend beyond thoſe things whereunto he is called by Chriſt. 12. That the Church ha's authority to alter ſomething in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or to diſpenſe with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, or frame new lawes binding the conſcience. 13. That it is not lawfull for Miniſters of the Word to contract matrimony, or at leaſt to marry twice. 14. That it is not lawfull for Miniſters to receive a certain ſtipend. 15. That it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe an unknown tongue in the Church though no interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170534:186"/>be added. 16. That beſides God and Jeſus Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, it is lawfull for men to call upon Saints departed, and to direct prayers and the ſacrifice of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to them. 17. That it is not lawfull for Chriſtians, during the Faſt of Lent, and certain other daies, to eate ſome kinds of food. 18. That the Church does well in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Soules of perſons decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they may be delivered from fire of Purgatory.</p>
